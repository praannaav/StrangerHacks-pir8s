          <p>The lack of accessible and user-friendly finance management tools has been a problem for individuals and startups alike. Managing finances can be overwhelming and time-consuming, and many people struggle to keep track of their expenditures, cut unnecessary costs, monitor savings, and forecast their financial status accurately. This is where our project comes in.</p>

<p>We are building a one-stop AI-powered finance tool that will help individuals and startups manage their finances effectively. The tool will incorporate AI technology to make it easier for users to interact with their financial data and gain a better understanding of their finances. Our project will have the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Track expenditure:</b> The tool will get data from the bank API endpoint to track user's expenditure and provide detailed reports on where their money is going.</li>
  <li><b>Cutting costs wherever possible:</b>Cutting costs wherever possible: Our project will use data analysis to identify areas where users can cut costs and save money.</li>
  <li><b>Monitor savings:</b> The tool will help users monitor their savings and track their progress towards their financial goals.</li>
  <li><b>Forecast expenditure, assets value, and savings:</b> We will use charting AI to predict and forecast expenditures and assets value for a period of time. The tool will also monitor savings to help users stay on track with their financial goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our UI will be built using React and Bootstrap, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate. We will host our tool on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable access for our users.</p>

<p>In addition to the above features, our tool will also include an AI chatbot that users can interact with by asking questions like "What's my expenses till date this month?" The chatbot will provide users with accurate and real-time information on their financial status, making it easier for them to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our project aims to provide a much-needed solution for individuals and startups struggling with managing their finances effectively. By incorporating AI technology, we hope to make it easier for users to interact with their financial data and gain a better understanding of their finances.</p>
