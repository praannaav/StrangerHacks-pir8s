# Submission of team pir8s to Devfolio<>StrangerHacks
**The idea:** We want to build a *one stop AI powered finance tool* for startups and individuals alike that helps users understand their finances and makes it easier to interact with their data.

**The problem** we aim to solve is the lack of an accessible and user-friendly finance management tool that incorporates AI technology to help individuals and startups track their expenditures, cut unnecessary costs, monitor their savings, and forecast their financial status accurately. Our goal is to make it easier for users to interact with their financial data and gain a better understanding of their finances to make informed decisions about their financial future. This tool will help users to cut costs wherever possible and also help them understand a lot about their savings.

**Outcomes**:

 - **Increase in accuracy and transparency when tracking spending:**
Al-driven data analysis enables organizations/individuals to analyze spending in real-time, track spending patterns, identify anomalies, and prevent fraudulent behavior. This increases the accuracy and transparency of financial tracking and can even help provide valuable insights on expenditure trends.
- **Automated financial reporting and analysis:** Al-powered tools can automatically generate financial reports and analysis. This can help reduce manual work and gain a better understanding of the finances at hand.

This is what we plan to implement.
1. Track Expenditure
2. Optimize Expenditure
3. Monitor Savings
4. Forecast Expenditure, Assets and Savings
5. Wrap it all up using React and bootstrap -> host on vercel.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
